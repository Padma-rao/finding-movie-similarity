# Finding movie similarity from plot summaries
In this project, I have used NLP and clustering to find the degree of similarity between movies based on their plots available on IMDb and Wikipedia.

Skills used in this project Natural Langauage Processing and Unsupervised machine learning.

The dataset contains the titles of the top 100 movies on IMDb as well as each movie's plot summary from both IMDb and Wikipedia.

# Project Tasks
1. Import and observe dataset
2. Combine Wikipedia and IMDb plot summaries
3. Tokenization
4. Stemming
5. Club together Tokenize & Stem
6. Create TfidfVectorizer
7. Fit transform TfidfVectorizer
8. Import KMeans and create clusters
9. Calculate similarity distance
10. Import Matplotlib, Linkage, and Dendrograms
11. Create merging and plot dendrogram
12. Which movies are most similar?
